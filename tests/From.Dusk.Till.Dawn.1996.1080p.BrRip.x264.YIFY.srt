7
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,964
Hey, Earl.
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:10,342
What do you know?
- Well...

9
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:16,056
It's a hot goddamn day.

10
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,267
I haven't felt it a bit.

11
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:22,437
Been inside with the air conditioner
blasting all day long.

12
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:25,106
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

13
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:32,405
Didn't you break for lunch or nothin'?

14
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:35,241
All by myself today.
Ate my lunch out of the microwave.

15
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:39,996
Jesus H. Christ, Pete.

16
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:44,250
When you gonna learn that microwave food
will kill you faster than a bullet?

17
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:47,420
I mean, them damn burritos
ain't good for nothin' but a hippie.

18
00:01:47,505 --> 00:01:49,589
When he's high on weed.

19
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:54,260
- Pull me down a bottle of that Jack, will ya?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:58,556
I think I'm gonna get tanked tonight.

21
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,230
What's the matter?

22
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:08,483
Yep.

23
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:12,529
It's been one long, goddamn,
hot, miserable, shit-ass, fuckin' day,

24
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:15,198
every inch of the way.

25
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:19,244
First off. Nadine over at Blue Chip
got sort of sick.

26
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:23,081
So she got that goddamn,
Mongoloid boy of hers workin' the grill.

27
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:26,960
I mean, that fuckin' idiot
doesn't know rat shit from Rice Krispies.

28
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:29,963
They eat breakfast about 9:00.

29
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:32,882
And I'm pukin' up pigs in a blanket,

30
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:35,760
like a sick, fuckin' dog by 10:30.

31
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:40,640
Isn't there a law or something
against retards serving food to the public?

32
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:43,393
Well... If there ain't, there oughta be.

33
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:45,478
I mean, who in the hell knows
what's goin' on

34
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:46,813
in the mind of a goddamn Mongoloid?

35
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:51,234
Nadine should've hit that boy
in the head and sold the fuckin' milk.

36
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:53,820
You could sue the shit out of her,
you know that?

37
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:56,656
That kid belongs under a circus tent,
not flippin' burgers.

38
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,827
- You could own that fuckin' place.
- Oh, shit, Pete.

39
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,455
What would I do with that grease pit?

40
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:07,542
Besides, Nadine's got a cross to bear.

41
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:11,046
I mean, taking care of that potato head.

42
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:19,471
I guess you heard about that shit
up in Abilene? Bank robbery?

43
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:21,806
That's all that's been on the box all day.

44
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,060
They killed some people, didn't they?

45
00:03:25,144 --> 00:03:28,188
Yeah. Killed four Rangers,

46
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:31,983
three cops,

47
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,944
one civilian.

48
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:38,198
Took a lady bank teller, hostage with them.

49
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:43,787
Supposed to be headed for the border,
which'd bring 'em right my way.

50
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:49,709
If I get my hands on them crazy, sick,
fuckin' bastards, it's payback time.

51
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:54,506
I mean... Well, we'll get 'em.

52
00:03:58,552 --> 00:03:59,969
We'll get 'em.

53
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,388
Oh, I don't doubt it.

54
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:04,933
Well...

55
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,685
I gotta drain my lizard.

56
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:08,728
Mind if I use your commode?

57
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,940
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

58
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:14,359
You're welcome.

59
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,453
You think I'm fuckin' playin' with you,
asshole?

60
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:29,082
Do you want this little girl to die?
Or that little girl? Or yourself?

61
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,502
Or your bosom buddy with the badge?
Now, I don't wanna do it.

62
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:36,714
But I will turn this place into the fucking,
Wild Bunch if I think you are fuckin' with me.

63
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:38,299
What do you want from me?
I did what you said.

64
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,301
You let him use the bathroom.

65
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:43,012
- No store does that.
- He comes in here everyday and we bullshit.

66
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:44,973
He's used my toilet a thousand times.
If I told him no,

67
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:47,308
- he'd know something was up.
- All right, I want him out of here,

68
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:51,187
in his car and down the road
or you can change the name of this place

69
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:53,690
to Benny's Worid of Blood.

70
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:06,786
- Were you giving that pig signals?
- Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!

71
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:12,750
- He says you were scratching.
- I wasn't scratchin'!

72
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:15,628
- Are you callin' him a liar?
- I'm not callin' him a liar, okay?

73
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,964
I'm simply sayin', if I was scratchin',
I don't remember scratchin'.

74
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,549
And If I did scratch,
it's not because I was signaling.

75
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:20,884
It's because I'm fuckin' scared shitless!

76
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,345
Wait a minute. The guy's in the bathroom.

77
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,472
Why don't I just go back there,
shoot him in the back of the head

78
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,349
- and we can get the hell outta here.
- Don't do that.

79
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,935
Look. You asked me to act natural
and I acted natural.

80
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:32,312
Under the circumstances, I think I oughta get

81
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:34,105
a fuckin' Academy Award
for how natural I'm actin'.

82
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:36,900
You asked me to get rid of him.
I'm doin' my best!

83
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:41,487
Well, your best better get
a hell of a lot fuckin' better

84
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:44,782
or you are gonna feel
a hell of a lot fuckin' worse.

85
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:50,038
Everybody, be cool. You... Be cool.

86
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:07,513
Yep. Be back at it tomorrow.

87
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:10,850
Tonight I'm gonna sit in front of that box
and get higher than a Georgia pine.

88
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:13,937
How much you want for that hooch, Pete?

89
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:16,814
Oh, $6.50.

90
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:18,524
Jesus Christ.

91
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:20,860
- You buckin' for early retirement?
- Shit, yeah.

92
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:26,199
Hey! Hey!

93
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,993
- What the fuck is that about?
- He signaled the Ranger.

94
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:31,663
I didn't! Ya gotta believe me! I didn't!

95
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:34,165
When they were talking,
he mouthed the words, "Help us."

96
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,960
- You fuckin' liar! I didn't say shit!
- Oh, just shut the hell up!

97
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:41,339
Hey! You stop it!
What the fuck is your problem?

98
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:45,051
- Goddamn it.
- Seth, he did it!

99
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:47,387
You were by the beer cooler
with your back turned.

100
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:49,889
I was by the magazines. I could see his face!

101
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:53,268
And I saw him mouth the words, "Help us."

102
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,063
Start the car.

103
00:06:57,147 --> 00:07:00,233
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yes. Shut up and start the car, all right.

104
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:01,359
Start the car.
- You believe me?

105
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:04,737
Start the car. You know that?
Shut the fuck up and start the car.

106
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,240
Wait a minute.
- I believe you. Start the car!

107
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:08,908
You're not just saying that?

108
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:10,660
- You do believe me?
- I believe you! Let's go!

109
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,829
- That means you believe me.
- Yes, I believe you!

110
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:15,665
You should, because I'm right.

111
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,762
- Richie!
- Yeah?

112
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,184
- You okay?
- He shot me in the fucking hand!

113
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:39,856
- Like I told you he said "Help us."
- I never said, "Help us"!

114
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,276
Well, that doesn't matter now, because you
got about two fuckin' seconds to live!

115
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:47,989
- Richie?
- Yeah?

116
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:51,159
When I count to three,
you shoot the bottles out from behind him.

117
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:53,619
Oh, yeah!

118
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:57,040
- One...
- Fuck!

119
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:58,624
Two...

120
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,546
Three!

121
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,810
What did I tell you? What did I say to you?

122
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,645
I said, "Buy the roadmap and leave."

123
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,188
What the fuck am I supposed to do, Seth?

124
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,399
- He recognized us.
- He didn't recognize shit.

125
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:06,526
Seth, I'm telling you,
the way he looked at us.

126
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:09,195
You, especially, I knew he knew.

127
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,366
Low profile! Do you understand
the meaning of the words "low profile"?

128
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:16,119
"Hey, Richie, how's your hand?"
"It hurts like a fuckin' son of a bitch!

129
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:18,704
"Thanks for askin'."
- Let me tell you what "low profile" is not.

130
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:23,042
It is not taking giris hostage.
It is not shooting police.

131
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:27,922
- It is not setting fire to a building.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

132
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:44,647
Hot air hangs like a dead man

133
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:47,316
From a white oak tree

134
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:51,612
People sittin' on porches

135
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:54,490
Thinkin' how things used to be

136
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:57,660
Dark night

137
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:59,745
It's a dark night

138
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,708
Dark night

139
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:07,170
It's a dark night

140
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,552
My wife left home about a week ago

141
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,972
She stole the kids
and she took all my dough

142
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:48,604
Oh, screw it! Goddamn you! Goddamn you!

143
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,692
What the hell do you want?

144
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:56,195
What do you think I want, you mean,
old bastard? I want a fuckin' room.

145
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:58,656
Okay, all right.

146
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:03,911
She peed on the carpet
She shot my horse

147
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:06,747
Now things are goin'
from better to bad to worse

148
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,127
- Do they have cable?
- No.

149
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:16,841
- Do they have the X-rated channel?
No.

150
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:19,927
Do they have a water bed?
- Nope.

151
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:22,221
- What do they got?
- They have four walls and a roof

152
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,889
and that's all we need.

153
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:36,736
All right, pop the trunk.
Let's do this fast.

154
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,371
Oh.

155
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:48,414
Don't say a word.

156
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:54,545
You, plant yourself in that seat.

157
00:12:57,591 --> 00:13:01,636
- What are you gonna do with me?
- I said "plant yourself." Plants don't talk.

158
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,931
Now, you wanna get on my good side?
You sit still and you don't make a peep.

159
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:13,105
All right, how does this feel?

160
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,232
How do you think?
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

161
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:22,615
- It's wrapped too tight. Nice and easy.
- Okay.

162
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,950
All right. Okay, I'm gonna go get the money.

163
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:49,308
It's 6:00.
What time's it get dark around here?

164
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,935
- About 8:00.
- Good.

165
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,646
I'm goin' to the border, check things out.
I'm gonna call Carlos,

166
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,232
try and arrange some sort of a rendezvous.
I don't know what.

167
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:58,693
Could you see if he could arrange
a better deal than 30%?

168
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,903
It's their standard deal.
They're not gonna change that for us.

169
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,656
- Did you even try and negotiate with them?
- Richie.

170
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,618
These guys are not spic firecracker salesmen
from Tijuana.

171
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,329
They don't even know the meaning
of the word "barter."

172
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:14,792
You wanna stay in El Rey, you give them
30% of your loot. It's scripture.

173
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:17,962
So it is written, so shall it be done.
Yeah, I know, listen.

174
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:23,008
Hey, you want sanctuary,
you gotta pay the price. The price is 30%.

175
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:25,678
- All I'm sayin', man...
- This conversation's over.

176
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,140
Okay?

177
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:34,520
We need to have a talk.

178
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:37,523
- What's your name?
- Gloria.

179
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:39,692
Hello, Gloria. I'm Seth.
That's my brother Richie.

180
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,569
Let's cut to the chase.

181
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:45,072
I'm gonna ask you one question
and all I want is a yes or no answer.

182
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,868
Do you wanna live through this?

183
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,703
- Yes.
- Good.

184
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:55,082
Rule number one. No noise. No questions.

185
00:14:55,167 --> 00:15:00,713
If you make a noise, Mr. 44 makes a noise.

186
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:04,216
If you ask a question, Mr. 44 answers it.

187
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,846
Now are you absolutely,
positively clear about rule number one?

188
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,892
- Yes.
- Rule number two.

189
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:15,144
You do what we say, when we say it.

190
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:17,897
If you don't, see rule number one.

191
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:23,277
Rule number three.
Don't you ever try and fucking run on us,

192
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:29,366
'cause I got six little friends
and they can all run faster than you can.

193
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,495
Open your eyes.

194
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:38,375
Gloria, you hang in there,
you follow the rules.

195
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:41,837
And you don't fuck with us
and you'll get out of this alive.

196
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:45,007
- I give you my word.
- Okay.

197
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,392
I'll be back in a minute.

198
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:12,952
You wanna come over on the bed
and watch TV with me?

199
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,056
Hail!

200
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,516
Come on.

201
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:49,113
Have a seat.

202
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:58,914
Take off your shoes.

203
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:19,059
You got about two more hours

204
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:22,271
until we get into El Paso

205
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:25,024
which is right next to the border.

206
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:26,901
Then we'll stop at a motel.

207
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:27,985
Stop?

208
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:30,362
We're not actually gonna
stop at a motel, are we?

209
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:33,282
Yeah, what for? We have a motor home.

210
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:37,119
We don't wanna stay in
those roach-haven motels, do we?

211
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:38,954
- We're self-contained.
- We're self-contained.

212
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,539
Okay, okay.

213
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:45,044
Maybe I was a little overzealous.
But gimme a break, I just bought it.

214
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:48,964
- How come you wanna stop anyways, Dad?
- I'm exhausted.

215
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:53,135
Exhausted? Just lie in the back, Dad.
I can drive us into Mexico.

216
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:56,555
I just bet you would.
Don't even think about it.

217
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:59,850
Besides, I wanna have

218
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:02,937
just one night's sleep
in an honest to goodness bed.

219
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:07,107
The beds in the home are okay, but...

220
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:10,235
They're not like a real bed.

221
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,113
Excuse me. I have to use the restroom.

222
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:27,378
Oh, guess what? When I called
the machine to check the messages,

223
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:30,839
one of them was from Bethel Baptist.

224
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:33,384
And Mr. Franklin said that

225
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:37,554
he wouldn't permanently replace you
until we came back.

226
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:40,933
- And he said that...
- That's very nice of Ted.

227
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:44,061
But I'll call him tomorrow
and tell him not to bother waiting.

228
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:56,407
Daddy, I didn't wanna talk about this
in front of Scott because he gets upset.

229
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:58,993
But I just wanna know.

230
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,746
Don't you believe in God anymore?

231
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,001
Not enough to be a pastor.

232
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:12,464
Look, I know this is hard on you kids.

233
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:16,427
But after Jenny's death, this is
probably the last thing you need,

234
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:21,181
but my congregation
needs spiritual leadership.

235
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:24,351
Well... My faith is gone.

236
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:29,606
To answer your question.
Yes, I do believe in Jesus.

237
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:33,652
Yes, I do believe in God.

238
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:37,031
But do I love them?

239
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:39,158
No.

240
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:43,746
Well, it's just
that all our lives, you've been a pastor.

241
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,959
And then, one day you're just
gonna wake up and say, "Fuck him"?

242
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,463
I didn't say, "Fuck him."

243
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:57,676
Every person who

244
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:03,015
chooses the service of God
as his life's work has something in common.

245
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:06,060
I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest,

246
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:09,021
a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk.

247
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:14,568
Many, many times during your life,
you'll look at your reflection in the mirror

248
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:16,862
and ask yourself,

249
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:20,032
"Am I a fool?"

250
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:22,868
I'm not going through a lapse.

251
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,538
What I've experienced is closer to awakening.

252
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:30,834
But Daddy,

253
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:33,420
what do you think Mom would say?

254
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:37,925
Mama's got nothin' to say. She's dead.

255
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,889
This bloody crime spree
started just a week ago today.

256
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:46,934
The oldest of the two brothers, Seth Gecko,

257
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:50,562
was serving time in Roll
Kansas State Penitent

258
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:54,149
for his part in the 1988
Scott City bank robbery

259
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:57,236
in which two law enforcement
officers lost their lives.

260
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,407
It was while at the courthouse that this man,
his younger brother, Richard Gecko,

261
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:07,579
a known armed robber and sex offender
pulled off a daring daylight escape,

262
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:12,960
resulting in the death of four Wichita
law enforcement officers and this woman,

263
00:21:13,044 --> 00:21:16,630
Heidi Vogel, sixth grade teacher,
who was run over by the Geckos

264
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:19,716
during a high-speed pursuit
through downtown Wichita.

265
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,971
And earlier today, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs,

266
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:27,933
the Gecko brothers killed
another Texas Ranger,

267
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:31,270
Earl McGraw and liquor store clerk,
Pete Bottoms.

268
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:34,356
That changes the death toll to 16.

269
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,694
Five Texas Rangers,
eight police officers, three civilians

270
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:42,906
and one hostage,
bank teller and mother of four, Gloria Hi

271
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:46,118
For the time being, we're very confident
that we'll apprehend these fugitives

272
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:48,120
within the next 48 hours.

273
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:51,248
The Bureau, local law enforcement
and the Texas Rangers

274
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:56,128
have all joined in forming a dragnet
to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.

275
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:59,131
Is it safe to assume that because of
the death count involved

276
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:02,384
and the loss of life
of law enforcement officers,

277
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:04,636
that the Bureau, the Rangers
and the police force

278
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:07,306
are taking this manhunt personally?

279
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,309
I would say that's a very safe assumption.

280
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:27,659
Shit, I was really worried.
Where the fuck you been, man?

281
00:22:27,702 --> 00:22:30,412
- Sightseeing.
- What'd you see?

282
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:31,663
The cops.

283
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:34,208
- Did you see the border?
- Yes, I saw the border.

284
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,834
What'd the TV say?

285
00:22:35,877 --> 00:22:39,421
They're gonna apprehend us
in about 48 hours.

286
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:42,090
I gotta figure out a way
to get us across this goddamn border.

287
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:47,429
The longer we stay here,
our lives ain't worth shit. Here you go.

288
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:50,140
We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight.

289
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:53,602
Then Carlos is gonna meet us there
at the rendezvous tomorrow morning.

290
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:59,024
He and his boys,
all of them are gonna escort us into El Rey.

291
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,984
And...

292
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:05,739
- Where's the woman?
- What?

293
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:08,742
What do you mean, what? The woman.
The hostage, the fuckin' hostage.

294
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:10,911
Richard, where is she?

295
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:13,664
She's in there.

296
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:16,917
- What the fuck is she doin' in there?
- Seth, wait a minute.

297
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,919
Seth.

298
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:32,266
Richard, what's wrong with you?

299
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,433
Before you flip out, okay,

300
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:37,187
- let me just explain what happened.
- Explain to me.

301
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,400
I need an explanation.
What is the matter with you?

302
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:43,402
There's nothing wrong with me, Brother.

303
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:45,529
That woman tried to escape
and I did what I had to.

304
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:48,407
No, the woman wouldn't have
said shit if she had a mouth full of it.

305
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:50,659
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

306
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:52,661
- Yeah.
- After you left,

307
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:56,707
- she became a completely different person.
- Yeah.

308
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:02,504
Is it me? Is it my fault?

309
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,923
- It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

310
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:08,260
- No, it's her fault. It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

311
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:12,055
- Do you think that this is what I am?
- I don't.

312
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:15,726
This is not me.
I am a professional fucking thief.

313
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:20,272
I don't kill people that I don't have to
and I don't fucking rape women.

314
00:24:20,356 --> 00:24:23,442
What you are doing...
What you are fucking doing...

315
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:27,821
What you are doing is not how it's done.
Do you understand that? Do you?

316
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:31,825
Just say, "Fucking yes."
Say, "Yes, Seth, I understand."

317
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:32,909
Yes, Seth, I understand.

318
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:35,454
Say it. Say, "Yes, Seth,
I fucking understand!"

319
00:24:35,496 --> 00:24:38,749
I understand, Seth. I fucking understand.

320
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,340
We'll get to Mexico and
it's gonna be sweet rosemary

321
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:48,050
and a hundred proof liquor...

322
00:24:49,177 --> 00:24:52,387
...and rice and beans and none
of this shit's gonna matter.

323
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:04,983
I can't believe he's stoppin' here.
This place is totally cruddy.

324
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,159
Dad, why are we stoppin' here?

325
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,289
There's nothin' wrong with this place.

326
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:22,084
It's a flophouse.

327
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:25,337
It's not a flophouse.

328
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:28,173
It's basic and it's simple.

329
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:31,218
That doesn't make it a flophouse.

330
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:34,096
All right. Well, if it doesn't have a pool,

331
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,973
then we're goin' someplace else.

332
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:40,185
It has a bed.

333
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:43,146
That's all I care about.

334
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:45,690
Well, other places have beds, too,

335
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:48,735
and they also have a gym...

336
00:25:57,245 --> 00:26:00,789
Geez, what is this guy's problem?

337
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:03,250
No idea.

338
00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:10,132
Creepy guy.

339
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:25,856
What?

340
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:29,818
Yes, I'm your neighbor
from room 11

341
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:33,905
and I hate to disturb you,
but I'd like to ask a favor.

342
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:44,082
I hope none of this is disturbin' you.

343
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:54,050
Hi. I'm from room 11.

344
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:58,054
And me and my lady friend need some ice
and we don't seem to have an ice bucket.

345
00:26:58,097 --> 00:27:03,101
If it's not too much trouble, could I possibly
borrow yours? I'll bring it right back.

346
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:08,190
- Sure.
- Thank you.

347
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:16,698
What is this?

348
00:27:18,868 --> 00:27:20,535
It's called a punch.

349
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,662
Lose the guitar.

350
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:27,792
What's your name?

351
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:29,961
- Jacob.
- Jacob, get up. Get on the bed.

352
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:33,465
If you make a wrong move,
I will shoot you in the face.

353
00:27:33,508 --> 00:27:34,549
Open your mouth.

354
00:27:34,634 --> 00:27:35,842
Wide!

355
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,472
Let's go.
Let's move the Jap over here, too. Let's go.

356
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:52,734
So what's the story with you two?
You a couple of fags?

357
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:53,985
He's my son.

358
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,446
How's that happened?
You don't look Japanese.

359
00:27:56,489 --> 00:28:00,033
Neither does he. He looks Chinese.

360
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,328
Oh, ooh, well, excuse me all to hell.

361
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:08,625
- What's this about, money?
- It's about money, all right, but not yours.

362
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:12,295
My brother and I, we're in a little hot water
and we need your assistance.

363
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:15,423
Stop!

364
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:19,010
What's goin' on?

365
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:22,430
We're having a bikini contest
and you just won.

366
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:25,392
It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

367
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:28,395
Just listen to your daddy, sugar,
and you don't do anything stupid.

368
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,189
You two, Simon says, sit the fuck down.

369
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:33,024
Sit down.

370
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:38,572
Now, where are the keys
to the motor home?

371
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,741
- On the dresser.
- Good. All right.

372
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:46,621
Richie, you take these keys, you start
this big bastard up and drive it up front.

373
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:55,422
Richie, would you do me a favor
and eat my pussy for me? Please?

374
00:28:55,506 --> 00:28:59,884
- Sure.
- Richie, hey!

375
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:02,095
Not when you get around to it. Now.

376
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:17,944
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom
and put on some clothes.

377
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:23,199
You got three minutes. One second longer,
I shoot your father in the face.

378
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:25,410
- Do you understand what I just said?
- Yes.

379
00:29:25,494 --> 00:29:26,995
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

380
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,748
You damn well better. Go.

381
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,307
Look, if you want the motor home,

382
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:49,392
just take it and get out.

383
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:53,938
It's not gonna be that easy, Pops.
We're gonna go on a little ride.

384
00:29:57,026 --> 00:29:59,069
Not a chance.

385
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:04,574
- Come again?
- If you're takin' people, take me.

386
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,789
But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.

387
00:30:10,831 --> 00:30:13,583
Sorry, Pops. I need everybody.

388
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:16,961
My children are not goin' with you
and that's that.

389
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:21,549
That's not fucking that. This is fucking this.

390
00:30:21,634 --> 00:30:23,218
Dad.

391
00:30:24,804 --> 00:30:27,263
You sit down. Sit down.

392
00:30:28,683 --> 00:30:30,975
You, go sit over there.
Go sit over there, now. Move it.

393
00:30:31,018 --> 00:30:32,811
Sit down.

394
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:40,026
Now, I don't have time to fuck around,
so I'm gonna make this simple.

395
00:30:40,111 --> 00:30:42,612
You take your kids
and you get in that motor home

396
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:45,573
or I will execute all three of you right now.

397
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:51,371
So, what's it gonna be?

398
00:30:51,455 --> 00:30:53,540
Yes or no, answer.

399
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:56,334
Yes.

400
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:58,962
Hey, your old man's all right.
He just saved your life.

401
00:31:01,465 --> 00:31:04,509
Time's up, princess. Here we go.

402
00:31:05,511 --> 00:31:08,179
Okay, ramblers, let's get rambling.

403
00:31:22,153 --> 00:31:23,528
Excuse me.

404
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,905
What?

405
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:31,202
- Where are you takin' us?
- Mexico.

406
00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:33,204
What's in Mexico?

407
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,540
Mexicans.

408
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:40,336
- Richie?
- Yeah?

409
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,214
Put in your bit.

410
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:01,566
I grind my teeth.

411
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:05,487
What are their names?

412
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:08,281
- Scott and Kate.
- Scott and Kate.

413
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:10,533
Who's this?

414
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:15,455
- My wife.
- Where is the little lady?

415
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:21,753
- In heaven.
- She dead?

416
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:23,463
Yes, she is.

417
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:26,633
How'd she die?

418
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:28,718
Auto wreck.

419
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:32,138
Come on, Jacob. Gimme some more details.

420
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:35,934
How'd it happen?
Some fucking drunk kill her?

421
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:39,145
No. It was a rainy night.

422
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:44,400
The brakes on the car weren't great.

423
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:47,403
She had to stop suddenly.

424
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:51,199
She slid on the road. She crashed. She died.

425
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:54,285
- She died right away?
- Not quite.

426
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:59,541
She was trapped in the wreck
for about six hours

427
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:02,335
before she passed on.

428
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:07,757
Yep. Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

429
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,552
Yes, they do.

430
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:13,137
Is that real?

431
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,808
- Yes.
- I've seen one of these things before.

432
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:20,645
A friend of mine had himself ordained,
a minister of his own religion.

433
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:23,982
Some way to fuck the IRS.

434
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:26,317
Is that what you're doing
or are you the real McCoy?

435
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:29,112
The real McCoy?

436
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:31,656
You're a preacher?

437
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,784
I was a minister.

438
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:37,996
"Was" as in not anymore?

439
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:40,081
- Yes.
- Why'd you quit?

440
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:41,666
I think I've gotten about

441
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,836
as up close and personal with you
as I'm gonna get.

442
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:49,799
Let's just keep this friendly, okay, Pops?
Let's not get too sensitive.

443
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:56,222
You're right. Enough with
the gettin' to know you shit. All right.

444
00:33:56,307 --> 00:33:58,933
I don't give a rat's ass about you
or your fuckin' family.

445
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:02,979
You can all live forever
or you can die this second.

446
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:05,189
And I don't give a shit which.

447
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:07,317
The only things that I care about are me,

448
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,652
that son of a bitch back there in the back
and our money.

449
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:13,156
So you help us get across the border
without incident.

450
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:15,867
You stay with us through the night
without trying anything funny,

451
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:17,827
without trying to escape.

452
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,164
And in the morning,
I'm gonna let you guys go, all of you.

453
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:23,708
How do I know you'll keep your word?

454
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:26,210
You have to convince me
you're tellin' the truth.

455
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:29,130
Look, dickhead, the only thing
that you have to be convinced about

456
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:33,551
is the fact that you are stuck in a situation
with a couple of real mean motor scooters.

457
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:36,679
And I don't want to have
to worry about you all fuckin' night.

458
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:39,682
You know, I don't think you wanna be
worrying about my brother's intentions

459
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:42,936
towards your daughter all night, either.

460
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,687
Did you notice the way
he was looking at her?

461
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,772
Yes.

462
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:47,774
- You didn't like it, did you?
- No, I didn't.

463
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:50,902
I didn't think so. You get us into Mexico

464
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:55,031
and you don't try to escape
and your daughter will be safe.

465
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:59,118
And in the morning, I will let you go.
I give you my word, Jacob.

466
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:05,917
If he touches her, I'll kill him!

467
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,712
Fair enough.
You break your word, I'll kill all of ya.

468
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:17,261
You got me all crazy

469
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:20,390
I can't get outta bed

470
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,603
Bones are achin'

471
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:28,523
Backed up in my head

472
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:32,610
Dengue woman

473
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:38,324
Stay away from me

474
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,918
You got your aches and pains

475
00:35:51,463 --> 00:35:55,174
Over me

476
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:08,021
Did you mean what you said
back there in the room?

477
00:36:09,982 --> 00:36:11,566
What?

478
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:16,821
In the room?

479
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:19,490
Did you mean what you said back there,
or were you just foolin' around?

480
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:24,829
Because if you really want me to do that
for you, I will. I'd be happy to.

481
00:36:27,124 --> 00:36:31,169
- Do what?
- What you said back there in the room?

482
00:36:31,211 --> 00:36:33,463
What did I say?

483
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:37,341
- You asked me if I would eat...
Richie.

484
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:38,384
What?

485
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:41,262
I told you to watch those kids.
Not to talk to them.

486
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:44,724
You don't have nothin' to say
to one another. So let's just cut the chatter.

487
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:49,353
We'll talk later. Okay?

488
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,215
All right, everybody. It's show time.

489
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:21,761
Richie, you take Kate into the bathroom.
Scott, get up here with your dad. Let's go.

490
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:26,390
Now, what are you gonna say?

491
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,061
I don't have the slightest idea.

492
00:37:30,104 --> 00:37:33,189
Just keep thinking about the gun
next to Kate's head.

493
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,651
Get in.

494
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:47,745
This isn't gonna work, Seth.

495
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,748
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine.

496
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:54,085
Hey, what are you gonna do?

497
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:57,922
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.

498
00:37:58,006 --> 00:38:00,925
Dad, you have to tell them
that they're back there.

499
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:02,927
Have you forgotten about your sister?

500
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:06,556
I want to go on record right now
as saying that this is a very bad idea.

501
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:08,599
Duly noted. Now shut up.

502
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,563
Oh, my God. Look over here.
Step right over there.

503
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:18,025
They're gonna kill us, Dad.
They're gonna get us across the border,

504
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,778
take us out in the desert,
then they're gonna fuckin' shoot us.

505
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:23,281
If they get over the border,
they're gonna let us go.

506
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:28,911
No, they won't. Dad, come on. I watch those
reality shows. They never let anybody go.

507
00:38:28,954 --> 00:38:32,790
Any cop'll tell you, in a situation like this,
you get a chance, you go for it.

508
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,917
It may not seem like it,
but I know exactly what I'm doing.

509
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,294
You're gonna have to trust me on this.

510
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:38,171
I can't do that, Dad.

511
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,756
If you don't tell the cops, I will.

512
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,300
Now listen to me!

513
00:38:42,342 --> 00:38:45,094
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing!
You hear me?

514
00:38:47,598 --> 00:38:49,724
I'm running the show! I make the decisions!

515
00:38:49,808 --> 00:38:51,434
He is running the show.

516
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:53,519
- I'm running the show! I'm running the show!
- Dad!

517
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:57,648
Shh. I make the plays.

518
00:38:58,483 --> 00:38:59,567
You back the plays I make.

519
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:03,154
I need your cover.

520
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:05,573
Cover me.

521
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:13,122
How many with you?

522
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,957
Just my son and I.

523
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,669
What's your purpose in Mexico?

524
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:22,632
Vacation. I'm taking him
to see his first bullfight.

525
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:24,675
They're gonna search the van.

526
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:29,013
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut,
we're gonna be just fine.

527
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:32,475
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

528
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:34,727
- What?
- You just called me a fuckin' nut.

529
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,896
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

530
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,440
You said, "As long as
I don't act like a fucking nut"

531
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:41,359
implying that I've been acting
like a fucking nut.

532
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:43,527
Take a pill, all right. I just meant be cool.

533
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,571
Yeah, you meant that,
but you meant the other, too.

534
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:48,115
This is not the time, Richie.

535
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,662
Hey, fuck those spic pigs, man!
You called me a "fucking nut."

536
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:54,705
Now, where I come from,
that stops the train in its tracks.

537
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:56,707
Keep your fucking voice down.

538
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,917
Or what?

539
00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:01,712
- What was that?
- Hmm?

540
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:07,051
Oh! That was just...
Just my daughter in the bathroom.

541
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:10,930
I thought you said
it was just you and your son?

542
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:15,101
Um, I meant me and my son
and my daughter.

543
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:19,272
Open up. I'm comin' aboard.

544
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:29,365
What was the nuttiest thing I did, Seth?
I'm curious. Tell me. What was it?

545
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:31,701
- This is not the time, Richie.
- I know.

546
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:34,328
Was it possibly when your ass
was rotting in jail and I broke it out?

547
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:35,413
Is that the nuttiest thing?

548
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:38,249
That was nutty, huh? Not to mention stupid.

549
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:44,005
Thanks.

550
00:40:59,646 --> 00:41:01,105
I'm in the bathroom.

551
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:02,982
Open up. It's Border Patrol.

552
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,650
It's open.

553
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:13,451
Do you mind? Shut the fuckin' door, please!

554
00:41:15,162 --> 00:41:16,495
Excuse me.

555
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:31,469
Goddamn, that was intense!

556
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:39,810
Oh, baby, we did it. We're in Mexico.

557
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:43,689
We're fuckin' in Mexico,
you little piece of fuckin' shit!

558
00:41:43,774 --> 00:41:45,816
Come on! Kate, get out here.

559
00:41:50,572 --> 00:41:52,656
All right, listen up. Everybody, listen.

560
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:54,492
Now I know that I put you all through hell,

561
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:57,119
and I know that I have been
one rough pecker.

562
00:41:57,162 --> 00:42:00,956
But from here on out,
you guys are all in my cool book.

563
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:04,210
Scotty, I want you to help me with Richie.
We'll lay him down on the couch over there.

564
00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:06,462
Jacob, you're gonna keep
driving down this street

565
00:42:06,505 --> 00:42:08,672
until you come to another street
called De Gallo.

566
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:12,009
When you get to De Gallo,
you're gonna turn this big bastard left,

567
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:15,805
and you're gonna go down a couple of miles
until you see a bar called the Titty Twister.

568
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:17,598
From what I understand, you cannot miss it.

569
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:18,682
Then?

570
00:42:18,725 --> 00:42:22,019
And then you stop because
that's where we're going.

571
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,702
Don't make a career out of this, okay?

572
00:42:38,787 --> 00:42:39,870
Come on, hey.

573
00:42:41,206 --> 00:42:42,915
Hey, you okay?

574
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:48,087
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

575
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:50,506
I don't know. You just passed out.

576
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:51,549
I did?

577
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:53,592
Mmm-hmm. You said something
about your hand hurtin'

578
00:42:53,677 --> 00:42:55,261
and then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.

579
00:42:56,388 --> 00:42:58,013
Really?

580
00:42:58,056 --> 00:43:00,850
Head hit the toilet.
You scared the shit out of me.

581
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:02,977
You sure you're okay?

582
00:43:04,104 --> 00:43:07,940
Yeah. I think so. I'm just a little fucked up.

583
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:12,570
Well, let me tell you something
that's gonna clear your head right up.

584
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:13,737
What?

585
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,282
We are officially Mexicans.

586
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:20,411
We're in Mexico, buddy.

587
00:43:20,454 --> 00:43:21,454
- We are?
- Yeah.

588
00:43:21,538 --> 00:43:23,080
We're heading down to
the rendezvous right now.

589
00:43:23,123 --> 00:43:25,458
We're gonna pound booze, wait for Carlos.

590
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:28,252
When he gets there,
he's gonna take us down to El Rey.

591
00:43:28,295 --> 00:43:32,673
And then you and I, my brother,
we're gonna kick fuckin' back.

592
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:35,259
- How do you like them apples?
- Far out.

593
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:40,222
Where's my glasses?

594
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:43,893
Oh, uh... Yeah, they broke when you fell.

595
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:47,855
Fuck, Seth, these are like my only pair!

596
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:49,690
Don't worry about it.
We'll get you another pair.

597
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:51,942
Of course I'm gonna worry about it.
I can't fuckin' see!

598
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:53,569
I'll take care of it when we get to El Rey.

599
00:43:53,612 --> 00:43:55,279
Yeah, like some Mexican hole in the wall
is gonna have my prescription.

600
00:43:55,363 --> 00:43:58,449
It's not a big deal
until you make it a big deal.

601
00:43:58,492 --> 00:44:00,784
Richie, now, I was in a very good mood.

602
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:04,288
So stop bringing me down
with this bullshit!

603
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:08,876
I can't wear this shit.

604
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,462
Hey, guys. We're here.

605
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,499
Pussy!

606
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:57,007
All right, pussy, pussy, pussy!

607
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,468
Come on in, pussy lovers.

608
00:44:59,511 --> 00:45:02,846
Here at the Titty Twister,
we're slashin' pussy in half.

609
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:07,434
Give us an offer on our best selection
of pussy. This is a pussy blowout!

610
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,106
All right, we got white pussy, black pussy,
Spanish pussy, yellow pussy.

611
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,024
We got hot pussy, cold pussy.

612
00:45:14,067 --> 00:45:17,361
We got wet pussy. We got smelly pussy.

613
00:45:17,404 --> 00:45:21,031
We got hairy pussy, bloody pussy.
We got snappin' pussy.

614
00:45:21,074 --> 00:45:24,285
We got silk pussy, velvet pussy,
naugahyde pussy.

615
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:27,788
We even got horse pussy,
dog pussy, chicken pussy.

616
00:45:27,872 --> 00:45:30,833
Come on, you want pussy.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

617
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:34,503
If we don't got it, you don't want it.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

618
00:45:41,386 --> 00:45:44,597
Okay, troops, it's the homestretch.
Here's the deal.

619
00:45:44,681 --> 00:45:49,560
This place closes at dawn. Carlos is gonna
meet us here sometime before dawn.

620
00:45:49,644 --> 00:45:51,895
Now, we are gonna go in there,
we're gonna take a seat,

621
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,856
we're gonna have a drink,
we're gonna have a bunch of drinks.

622
00:45:53,898 --> 00:45:55,983
And we're gonna wait for Carlos.

623
00:45:56,067 --> 00:45:58,819
Let me just say something.
I'm very happy about where we're at.

624
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:03,490
We got a real nice "I don't fuck with you,
you don't fuck with me" attitude goin' on.

625
00:46:03,575 --> 00:46:07,578
So if everybody just keeps playin' it cool,
I'm talkin' to you, too, Richie,

626
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:10,414
then everybody's gonna get what they want.

627
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:16,503
Okay, hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
I'm buyin'. Come on.

628
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:17,921
Here we go.

629
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:27,598
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

630
00:46:27,682 --> 00:46:32,353
Attention, pussy shoppers!
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.

631
00:46:32,437 --> 00:46:35,105
If you buy one piece of pussy
at the regular price,

632
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:40,110
you will get another piece of pussy of
equal or lesser value for only a penny.

633
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:42,571
Try and beat pussy for a penny.

634
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:47,159
If you can find cheaper pussy
anywhere, fuck it!

635
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,918
Hey, what do we have approaching here?
A new flavor, apple pie pussy.

636
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:59,296
Hey, not so fast, slick.

637
00:46:59,381 --> 00:47:00,506
Step aside, asshole.

638
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:02,841
Son of a...

639
00:47:04,344 --> 00:47:07,471
Now, is my shit together
or is my shit together?

640
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:10,307
Here we go.

641
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:17,481
Hi! How ya doin'? Enjoying it? I hope so!

642
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,496
Now, this is my kind of place.

643
00:48:02,235 --> 00:48:04,278
I could become a regular.

644
00:48:19,753 --> 00:48:21,044
Whiskey!

645
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:36,226
- You can't come in here.
- What do you mean?

646
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:39,062
It's a private bar. You're not welcome.

647
00:48:39,105 --> 00:48:42,191
Are you tellin' me that
I'm not good enough to drink here?

648
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:46,069
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.

649
00:48:47,655 --> 00:48:49,490
You, get out!

650
00:48:53,536 --> 00:48:55,746
- Take your hand off of me.
- I'm gonna count to three.

651
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,457
No, I'm gonna count to three.

652
00:48:58,541 --> 00:48:59,583
- One...
- Two...

653
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:02,169
Now, wait a minute.
There is no reason to get ugly.

654
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:05,756
There is just a misunderstanding
going on here.

655
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:10,260
You said this bar is for truckers and bikers?

656
00:49:10,303 --> 00:49:12,304
Well, I'm a truck driver.

657
00:49:12,764 --> 00:49:14,765
If you look outside your
door in your parking lot,

658
00:49:14,808 --> 00:49:18,101
you'll see a big recreational vehicle.

659
00:49:18,186 --> 00:49:19,436
That's mine.

660
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:23,774
In order to drive that legally,
you need a class two driver's license.

661
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:26,902
This bar is for truck drivers?

662
00:49:26,945 --> 00:49:28,821
I am a truck driver.

663
00:49:28,905 --> 00:49:30,781
These are my friends.

664
00:49:37,914 --> 00:49:40,082
Welcome to the Titty Twister.

665
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:43,126
- Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.
- Coming right up.

666
00:50:08,903 --> 00:50:11,822
- You serve food here, Jos?
- Best in Mexico.

667
00:50:11,906 --> 00:50:13,657
I kind of doubt that.

668
00:50:15,994 --> 00:50:19,997
We're gonna go over here. You send
a waitress over to take our order. Okay?

669
00:51:12,675 --> 00:51:15,260
Mary had a little lamb

670
00:51:16,346 --> 00:51:19,264
His fleece was black as coal, yeah

671
00:51:20,683 --> 00:51:24,895
Anytime you want a lap dance with
that girl, kid, just let me know, all right?

672
00:51:24,938 --> 00:51:26,313
It's on me.

673
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:30,776
Pass.

674
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:33,737
Is it against your religion?

675
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:37,240
No. I do drink. I'm just not drinkin' now.

676
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:39,076
Fair enough. More for me.

677
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,078
- Scott, how 'bout you?
- No.

678
00:51:41,162 --> 00:51:45,123
- Kate, how 'bout you?
- No, I can't. I'm not 21 yet.

679
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:47,459
That means yes.

680
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:49,670
Post time, Kate!

681
00:51:51,756 --> 00:51:53,006
Here we go. You slam it down.

682
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:55,217
You knock the glass down
on the table, all right?

683
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:56,885
One, two, three!

684
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:04,685
Attagirl, Kate.

685
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:06,812
Scotty, are you ready? Here we go.
You ready for one?

686
00:52:06,896 --> 00:52:07,938
Okay.

687
00:52:08,022 --> 00:52:09,231
- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will.

688
00:52:09,273 --> 00:52:12,275
Yes, he will, because
I'm not drinking by myself.

689
00:52:12,944 --> 00:52:14,569
Kate, round two.
You ready? Here we go.

690
00:52:14,612 --> 00:52:16,780
Yes, I'll have another one. Thank you.

691
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:18,573
On three. One, two, three.

692
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:32,170
Why are you so agitated?

693
00:52:32,588 --> 00:52:35,674
I'm still stewing about that ape
laying his hand on me.

694
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,634
What are you gonna do?

695
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,469
I'm gonna sit here and
I'm gonna finish with this bottle.

696
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:41,013
And when I'm finished,

697
00:52:41,097 --> 00:52:43,098
I'm gonna take this bottle
and I'm gonna bust it

698
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:44,891
over his melon fucking head!

699
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:49,104
Before we stepped in here,
you told all of us to be cool.

700
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:51,148
So, that means you, too.

701
00:52:51,232 --> 00:52:53,233
I never said do what I do.
I said do what I say.

702
00:52:56,029 --> 00:52:58,280
On my way I passed it

703
00:52:59,907 --> 00:53:01,283
Express yourself

704
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:19,176
Are you such a fucking loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

705
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,762
- What'd you call me?
- Nothing.

706
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:25,182
I didn't make a statement.
I asked a question.

707
00:53:25,516 --> 00:53:27,893
- Would you like me to ask it again?
- Mmm-hmm.

708
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:31,605
Are you such a loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

709
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:37,694
The entire state of Texas,
along with the FBI,

710
00:53:38,488 --> 00:53:39,738
are looking for you.

711
00:53:40,907 --> 00:53:42,157
Did they find you?

712
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:44,409
No, they couldn't.

713
00:53:45,495 --> 00:53:46,745
You've won, Seth.

714
00:53:48,998 --> 00:53:50,040
Enjoy it.

715
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,086
Jacob,

716
00:53:56,464 --> 00:53:59,466
I want you to have a drink with me. I insist.

717
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:05,722
To your family.

718
00:54:06,891 --> 00:54:07,974
To yours.

719
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:19,152
And now, for your viewing pleasure,

720
00:54:19,737 --> 00:54:21,321
the mistress of the macabre,

721
00:54:22,615 --> 00:54:23,865
the epitome of evil,

722
00:54:24,117 --> 00:54:26,993
the most sinister woman
to ever dance on the face of this Earth.

723
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:29,746
Bite this!
- Lowly dog!

724
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:34,376
Bow your head, kneel and worship

725
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,463
at the feet of Santanico Pandemonium.

726
00:55:33,352 --> 00:55:36,980
Watching her

727
00:55:37,023 --> 00:55:39,608
Strolling in the night

728
00:55:40,026 --> 00:55:41,318
So right

729
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:44,779
Wondering why

730
00:55:45,072 --> 00:55:48,575
It's only after dark

731
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,503
In her eyes

732
00:56:00,546 --> 00:56:03,381
The distant firelight

733
00:56:03,758 --> 00:56:05,300
Burns bright

734
00:56:05,635 --> 00:56:08,637
Wondering why

735
00:56:08,971 --> 00:56:12,307
It's only after dark

736
00:56:21,609 --> 00:56:25,195
Find myself in her room

737
00:56:26,405 --> 00:56:30,575
Feel the fever of my doom

738
00:56:31,202 --> 00:56:34,579
Falling for her through the floor

739
00:56:35,706 --> 00:56:39,125
I'm knocking on the devil's door

740
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,627
Yeah

741
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:19,392
Burning, burning in the flame

742
00:58:20,478 --> 00:58:24,481
Now that I know her secret name

743
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:28,610
You can tear her temple down

744
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,323
But she'll be back and rule again

745
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:34,532
Yeah

746
00:58:58,182 --> 00:58:59,933
That's what I call a fucking show!

747
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:05,105
Wow!

748
00:59:15,408 --> 00:59:16,449
Come here!

749
00:59:18,369 --> 00:59:19,953
That guy! It's the puta over there!

750
00:59:20,037 --> 00:59:21,329
Richie, get back on the clock.

751
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:26,126
- How many?
- Three.

752
00:59:29,004 --> 00:59:30,004
Which one?

753
00:59:31,257 --> 00:59:35,593
This piece of shit here, man.
Broke my finger and my nose!

754
00:59:36,387 --> 00:59:39,264
And this faggot kicked me
in the ribs while I was down.

755
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,225
- Up!
- Fuck you, bogeyman!

756
00:59:47,773 --> 00:59:49,065
Fuck!

757
00:59:52,027 --> 00:59:53,319
Fuck you!

758
01:00:04,248 --> 01:00:07,792
All right, everybody be cool,
or you'll be just as dead as these fucks!

759
01:00:09,753 --> 01:00:11,754
How's your hand? Let me see it.

760
01:00:14,508 --> 01:00:15,550
Shit.

761
01:00:25,102 --> 01:00:26,519
You think that was funny?

762
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:38,573
Sit down!

763
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:04,682
Richie, look out!

764
01:01:04,934 --> 01:01:07,810
Motherfucking shit! Get the fuck off me!

765
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:09,854
- Hey! Hey!
- Get her off me!

766
01:01:11,482 --> 01:01:13,149
What the fuck are you doing? Shoot her!

767
01:01:15,528 --> 01:01:16,653
I'm coming, buddy!

768
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:24,202
- Richie. Rich.
- You bitch.

769
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:27,080
Richie.

770
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:30,500
Fucking bitch!

771
01:01:31,961 --> 01:01:33,002
Richie.

772
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,762
Hey.

773
01:01:58,654 --> 01:01:59,904
What the fuck?

774
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:09,289
Dinner is served.

775
01:02:17,756 --> 01:02:19,132
What the fuck?

776
01:02:29,852 --> 01:02:31,394
Get off me!

777
01:02:47,328 --> 01:02:48,911
Come on! Come on, you!

778
01:02:50,205 --> 01:02:51,331
Jacob!

779
01:02:55,419 --> 01:02:57,420
Oh, no! Look out! Look out!

780
01:03:05,095 --> 01:03:07,347
You know what everybody
says about me, huh?

781
01:03:08,015 --> 01:03:09,098
I suck!

782
01:03:39,463 --> 01:03:41,464
Get off me! What the fuck are you doing?

783
01:03:47,846 --> 01:03:50,640
Let's see if you taste
as good as your brother.

784
01:03:52,768 --> 01:03:53,768
Fuck you!

785
01:04:14,123 --> 01:04:15,123
Hey! Hey!

786
01:04:30,764 --> 01:04:31,764
Oh, shit!

787
01:04:39,523 --> 01:04:40,565
Huh?

788
01:04:47,197 --> 01:04:48,239
Gimme that!

789
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:08,384
I'm not gonna drain you completely.

790
01:05:09,303 --> 01:05:10,845
You'll be my slave.

791
01:05:12,681 --> 01:05:14,724
Because I don't think you're
worthy of human blood,

792
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:17,226
you'll feed on the blood of stray dogs.

793
01:05:18,562 --> 01:05:19,729
You'll be my foot stool.

794
01:05:20,272 --> 01:05:23,941
And at my command,
you'll lick the dog shit from my boot heel.

795
01:05:25,819 --> 01:05:27,195
Since you'll be my dog,

796
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,615
your new name will be Spot.

797
01:05:32,785 --> 01:05:35,536
Welcome to slavery.

798
01:05:36,038 --> 01:05:38,039
No, thanks. I already had a wife.

799
01:06:03,607 --> 01:06:04,941
We might be in trouble.

800
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:13,074
Yo, monkey man.

801
01:06:15,994 --> 01:06:17,620
Anything you got to say to them,

802
01:06:20,374 --> 01:06:21,457
say to me first.

803
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:25,711
This!

804
01:06:46,191 --> 01:06:47,316
That's enough.

805
01:08:15,781 --> 01:08:17,323
Ain't they supposed to
burn up or something?

806
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,960
Oh, fuck.

807
01:08:40,722 --> 01:08:42,598
Now let's kill that fucking band!

808
01:08:43,642 --> 01:08:44,767
I can do that.

809
01:08:47,562 --> 01:08:49,522
Fuck you, everybody. Good night!

810
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:55,069
Fuckers.

811
01:09:12,963 --> 01:09:13,963
Hey, buddy.

812
01:09:16,758 --> 01:09:19,093
I'm sorry I fucked things up, Richie.

813
01:09:25,642 --> 01:09:28,060
You would've liked it in El Rey.
You would've...

814
01:09:30,105 --> 01:09:31,313
You would've found peace.

815
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,485
I love you, buddy.

816
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:40,656
I love you too, Seth.

817
01:09:54,463 --> 01:09:56,630
You touch my brother with that stake, biker,

818
01:09:56,673 --> 01:09:58,257
and vampires aren't gonna
have to suck your blood.

819
01:09:58,341 --> 01:09:59,842
They'll be able to lick it up off the floor.

820
01:09:59,885 --> 01:10:01,052
He's not your brother anymore.

821
01:10:01,136 --> 01:10:04,388
That's a matter of opinion
and I don't give a fuck about yours.

822
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:08,350
Don't be a fool! He'll kill us all.

823
01:10:08,393 --> 01:10:10,186
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

824
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:12,563
Let's go. Move, move.

825
01:10:29,706 --> 01:10:30,790
Hold him down.

826
01:10:37,172 --> 01:10:38,339
Richie.

827
01:10:39,633 --> 01:10:43,636
Here is the peace in death,
that I could not give you in life.

828
01:10:59,945 --> 01:11:01,070
Fuck!

829
01:11:12,082 --> 01:11:14,917
Seth, are you okay?

830
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:17,753
I'm peachy, Kate. The worid is my oyster.

831
01:11:22,259 --> 01:11:24,009
Except for the fact
that I just...

832
01:11:25,971 --> 01:11:29,598
I just rammed a wooden stake
into my brother's chest,

833
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:31,684
because he turned into a vampire.

834
01:11:32,269 --> 01:11:34,311
Even though I don't believe in vampires.

835
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:37,857
Aside from that unfortunate business,

836
01:11:38,942 --> 01:11:40,401
everything is hunky-dory.

837
01:11:43,822 --> 01:11:46,740
- I'm really, really sorry.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

838
01:11:48,618 --> 01:11:51,078
If it were up to you,
if you had half a chance,

839
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:53,038
you would feed us to those fucks.

840
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:54,415
Then why didn't I?

841
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:01,714
I'm sorry you lost your brother.
I'm sorry he's dead.

842
01:12:02,132 --> 01:12:03,966
I'm sorry everybody's dead.

843
01:12:04,384 --> 01:12:08,637
But if we're gonna get out of this,
we need you clean and sober and thinking.

844
01:12:08,722 --> 01:12:09,805
Not drunk.

845
01:12:13,977 --> 01:12:15,144
What is that?

846
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:19,440
Don't know. First I thought it was just birds.

847
01:12:23,028 --> 01:12:24,069
Bats.

848
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:31,994
Gimme a hand.

849
01:13:20,335 --> 01:13:21,377
No!

850
01:13:24,256 --> 01:13:25,339
Hey!

851
01:13:41,106 --> 01:13:42,606
I'm sorry.

852
01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:44,817
Come on!

853
01:13:54,786 --> 01:13:58,747
We'll take care of this mess,
you go stake the rest of those ugly fucks.

854
01:13:58,915 --> 01:13:59,957
Way ahead of you.

855
01:14:01,543 --> 01:14:04,420
- Watch your step. What's your name, girlie?
- Kate. What's yours?

856
01:14:04,462 --> 01:14:06,588
- Sex Machine. Pleased to meet you, Kate.
- You, too.

857
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:34,843
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

858
01:15:40,183 --> 01:15:42,226
Does anybody know
what's going on here?

859
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:43,519
I know what's going on.

860
01:15:44,062 --> 01:15:45,938
We've got a bunch
of fucking vampires out there,

861
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:48,690
trying to get in here
and suck our fucking blood,

862
01:15:48,775 --> 01:15:50,401
and that's it, plain and simple.

863
01:15:50,485 --> 01:15:53,320
And I don't wanna hear anything about
"I don't believe in vampires."

864
01:15:53,363 --> 01:15:58,117
Because I don't fucking believe in vampires,
but I believe in my own two eyes,

865
01:15:58,326 --> 01:16:00,953
and what I saw is fucking vampires.

866
01:16:01,037 --> 01:16:04,748
Now, do we all agree that what
we are dealing with is vampires?

867
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:07,668
Yes.
- You, too, preacher?

868
01:16:08,378 --> 01:16:11,713
I don't believe in vampires,
but I believe in what I saw.

869
01:16:11,798 --> 01:16:14,925
Good for you. All right, now that we all
agree that we're dealing with vampires,

870
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:16,552
what do we know about vampires?

871
01:16:17,262 --> 01:16:19,430
Crosses hurt vampires. Do we have a cross?

872
01:16:20,056 --> 01:16:21,348
In the motor home.

873
01:16:21,391 --> 01:16:22,433
In other words, no.

874
01:16:22,517 --> 01:16:25,769
Wait a second. I mean, just look around.
We got crosses all over the place.

875
01:16:25,854 --> 01:16:28,689
All you gotta do is put two sticks together
and you got a cross.

876
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:31,233
Yeah, he's right.
Peter Cushing does that all the time.

877
01:16:31,317 --> 01:16:34,528
Okay, I'll buy that.
So, we got crosses covered. What else?

878
01:16:34,737 --> 01:16:37,364
Wooden stakes in the heart
have been working pretty good so far.

879
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:42,744
And garlic, sunlight, holy water. I'm not sure.

880
01:16:42,871 --> 01:16:44,913
Doesn't silver have
something to do with vampires?

881
01:16:44,998 --> 01:16:46,248
That's werewolves.

882
01:16:46,332 --> 01:16:47,791
I know silver bullets are werewolves.

883
01:16:47,876 --> 01:16:50,169
But I'm sure silver has
something to do with vampires.

884
01:16:50,253 --> 01:16:52,296
Well, does anybody have any silver?

885
01:16:55,258 --> 01:16:56,925
Okay. Then, who cares?

886
01:16:58,261 --> 01:17:00,846
Has anybody here read
a real book about vampires,

887
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:03,307
or are we just remembering
what some movie said?

888
01:17:03,808 --> 01:17:06,810
I mean, a real book.
- You mean like a Time-Life book?

889
01:17:06,936 --> 01:17:09,730
I take it the answer's no. Okay, then.

890
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:12,024
What do we know about these vampires?

891
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:15,694
We know they got superhuman strength,
but we can hurt them.

892
01:17:15,778 --> 01:17:17,362
- Yeah.
Another thing, though is

893
01:17:17,447 --> 01:17:19,448
if you're gonna drive
a chair leg through a human,

894
01:17:19,782 --> 01:17:21,783
you better be one strong son of a bitch.

895
01:17:21,868 --> 01:17:25,537
I mean, the human body is
one rough, tough machine.

896
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:29,124
But these vamps, these vamps,
they have soft bodies.

897
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,503
The texture of their skin is soft
and they're mushier.

898
01:17:32,587 --> 01:17:34,046
You can push shit right through them.

899
01:17:34,255 --> 01:17:37,466
Conceivably, if you hit one hard enough,
take their head right off.

900
01:17:40,345 --> 01:17:44,515
Actually, our best weapon
against these satanic cocksuckers,

901
01:17:45,308 --> 01:17:46,308
is this man.

902
01:17:47,936 --> 01:17:49,144
He's a preacher.

903
01:17:49,896 --> 01:17:52,439
As far as God's concerned,
we might as well all be a piece of shit,

904
01:17:52,482 --> 01:17:53,982
but he's one of the boys.

905
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,361
Only one problem,
his faith isn't what it used to be.

906
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:03,951
I've had enough of your taunts.

907
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:08,956
I'm not taunting you, Jacob. We need you.

908
01:18:10,124 --> 01:18:13,752
A faithless preacher doesn't mean shit to us.

909
01:18:17,382 --> 01:18:22,302
A servant of God can take a cross
and shove it up these monsters' asses.

910
01:18:22,345 --> 01:18:26,932
A servant of God can bless the tap water
and make it a weapon.

911
01:18:29,686 --> 01:18:30,811
Jacob,

912
01:18:31,896 --> 01:18:33,564
I know why you lost your faith.

913
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:41,863
How could holiness exist if your wife can be
taken away from you and your children?

914
01:18:43,783 --> 01:18:46,535
Now, I've always said
that God can kiss my ass.

915
01:18:46,578 --> 01:18:49,955
But I just changed
my lifetime tune about 30 minutes ago.

916
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:54,001
'Cause I know that whatever is out there
trying to get in,

917
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:56,336
is pure evil, straight from hell.

918
01:18:56,379 --> 01:19:00,007
And if there is a hell,
and those sons of bitches are from it,

919
01:19:00,049 --> 01:19:03,051
then there has got to be a heaven, Jacob.
There's gotta be!

920
01:19:08,182 --> 01:19:09,391
So, which are you?

921
01:19:11,227 --> 01:19:13,103
Are you a faithless preacher,

922
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:15,856
or are you a mean
motherfucking servant of God?

923
01:19:25,992 --> 01:19:27,576
I'm a mean

924
01:19:30,496 --> 01:19:32,205
servant of God.

925
01:19:39,464 --> 01:19:42,257
I don't know if I can take
much more of that noise.

926
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,177
Sure you can.

927
01:19:47,305 --> 01:19:49,931
You can take it because you got no choice.

928
01:19:51,392 --> 01:19:55,604
How'd you like to spend 24 hours
of it lying in some muddy ditch,

929
01:19:56,189 --> 01:20:00,233
with nothing but the rotten corpses
of your friends to keep you company?

930
01:20:01,027 --> 01:20:02,653
What are you talking about?

931
01:20:07,617 --> 01:20:09,076
I was in 'Nam.

932
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:11,244
Back in '72.

933
01:20:13,289 --> 01:20:15,457
I was trapped behind enemy lines,

934
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:18,251
with my entire squad dead.

935
01:20:20,129 --> 01:20:21,838
They thought they had killed everyone.

936
01:20:23,549 --> 01:20:26,134
Except for me, they was right.

937
01:20:26,803 --> 01:20:28,970
But it wasn't for their lack of trying.

938
01:20:29,806 --> 01:20:31,056
A grenade,

939
01:20:32,016 --> 01:20:34,267
blew up right beside me.

940
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:37,938
That's why I'm so pretty.

941
01:20:39,148 --> 01:20:42,734
And they start pushing
all them bodies in on top of me.

942
01:20:43,152 --> 01:20:45,320
And all I could do, was lay there.

943
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:46,822
Play possum.

944
01:20:47,782 --> 01:20:50,325
Listen to the enemy joke, laugh,

945
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:54,371
hour after hour after hour.

946
01:21:04,382 --> 01:21:06,967
Sex Machine.

947
01:21:07,009 --> 01:21:09,386
Kill them.

948
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:11,388
Kill them.

949
01:21:13,558 --> 01:21:15,434
So I finally climbed out of this hole

950
01:21:16,853 --> 01:21:19,396
and I sneaked up on the enemy
while he was sleeping.

951
01:21:20,273 --> 01:21:24,609
And I killed one, two, three, four, five...

952
01:21:56,058 --> 01:21:57,851
When I came to my senses,

953
01:21:59,729 --> 01:22:04,191
I realized I had killed an entire VC squad.

954
01:22:04,817 --> 01:22:05,984
Single-handed.

955
01:22:06,736 --> 01:22:09,488
There was blood

956
01:22:10,615 --> 01:22:15,243
and chunks of yellow flesh,
clinging to my bayonet.

957
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:24,044
To this day, I don't remember...

958
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,423
Get him off of me! Get off of me!

959
01:22:28,466 --> 01:22:30,675
Please! Get him off!

960
01:22:35,306 --> 01:22:36,473
No!

961
01:22:44,148 --> 01:22:45,190
Dad!

962
01:22:59,455 --> 01:23:02,749
He fucking bit me. He fucking bit me.

963
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:05,877
What are you gonna do about it?

964
01:23:06,879 --> 01:23:08,129
Come on, Sex Machine.

965
01:23:19,183 --> 01:23:22,143
Oh, shit!

966
01:23:32,655 --> 01:23:35,240
Get up! Get up! Up! Come on!

967
01:23:46,878 --> 01:23:49,296
Go! Fuck!

968
01:23:59,807 --> 01:24:02,809
Wait, we have to go back for my father.

969
01:24:02,852 --> 01:24:04,603
Your dad's dead, Kate.

970
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:51,942
He is the light.

971
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:56,154
The people who walk

972
01:24:57,073 --> 01:24:58,573
in the darkness

973
01:25:00,451 --> 01:25:02,827
have seen the light!

974
01:25:27,603 --> 01:25:29,270
Open the door!

975
01:25:30,856 --> 01:25:32,232
Open the door!

976
01:25:36,028 --> 01:25:37,195
Go! Go!

977
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:38,822
Oh, Daddy!

978
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:40,949
Jacob, are you bit?

979
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:44,369
Yeah.

980
01:25:45,121 --> 01:25:48,581
Motherfuck. Motherfucking vampires!

981
01:25:48,624 --> 01:25:52,794
I'm gonna kill every last one of
you godless, fucking pieces of shit!

982
01:25:52,837 --> 01:25:54,671
You bet you are
and I'm gonna help you do it.

983
01:25:55,464 --> 01:25:57,090
But we ain't got much time.

984
01:25:57,383 --> 01:26:00,468
- You're gonna be okay, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

985
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,722
I've been bit.
In fact, I'm already dead.

986
01:26:04,849 --> 01:26:06,057
Now...

987
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,979
I'd say in the next 20 or 30 minutes,
our friends outside will bust in this door

988
01:26:11,147 --> 01:26:14,315
and I'll probably turn into a vampire
within the hour.

989
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,859
Now, you have two choices.

990
01:26:15,943 --> 01:26:18,987
You can wait for me to turn,
then deal with me.

991
01:26:19,321 --> 01:26:21,239
Or we can kick open that door,

992
01:26:21,657 --> 01:26:25,410
and the four of us can go at 'em,
hit 'em with everything we have.

993
01:26:26,037 --> 01:26:28,204
But if we're gonna go at 'em,
we gotta go at 'em now.

994
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:32,834
What's this stuff?

995
01:26:34,045 --> 01:26:36,254
My guess is this little dive

996
01:26:36,338 --> 01:26:39,591
has been feeding on bikers
and truckers for a long time.

997
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:42,469
This is probably the shipments
they stole off the trucks.

998
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:44,763
I say, let's tear this place apart for weapons.

999
01:26:44,847 --> 01:26:47,057
So when they burst through that door,
we'll make 'em wish they never did.

1000
01:26:47,141 --> 01:26:48,349
I don't care about living or dying anymore.

1001
01:26:48,434 --> 01:26:51,561
I just wanna send as many of
these devils back to hell, as I can.

1002
01:26:51,854 --> 01:26:52,937
Amen.

1003
01:27:56,252 --> 01:27:58,294
Loving God, bless this water

1004
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:02,507
and give us your protection and strength
in this, our darkest hour. Amen.

1005
01:28:11,267 --> 01:28:14,644
Before we go any further,
I need you three to promise me something.

1006
01:28:15,396 --> 01:28:18,439
I'll fight with you till the bitter end,
but when I turn into one of them,

1007
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:20,984
I won't be Jacob anymore.

1008
01:28:22,278 --> 01:28:24,028
I'll be a lapdog of Satan.

1009
01:28:24,947 --> 01:28:28,575
I want you three to promise you'll
take me down, no different from the rest.

1010
01:28:29,326 --> 01:28:30,493
I promise, Jacob.

1011
01:28:31,537 --> 01:28:33,079
Kate? Scott?

1012
01:28:34,498 --> 01:28:35,623
I promise.

1013
01:28:36,834 --> 01:28:39,169
- Scott?
- Yeah, I promise.

1014
01:28:42,464 --> 01:28:44,048
Why don't I believe you?

1015
01:28:47,136 --> 01:28:48,636
I'm gonna ask you two again.

1016
01:28:49,847 --> 01:28:52,182
Then I want you to swear to God,

1017
01:28:52,558 --> 01:28:54,225
that you'll kill me!

1018
01:28:55,519 --> 01:28:59,480
If you don't,
I'm gonna just kill myself right now.

1019
01:28:59,815 --> 01:29:03,109
Now, since you need me,
I think you better swear!

1020
01:29:04,153 --> 01:29:09,991
Kate, do you swear to God
that when I become one of the undead,

1021
01:29:10,743 --> 01:29:11,993
you'll kill me?

1022
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:15,496
Kate!

1023
01:29:15,998 --> 01:29:18,625
We don't have much time,
so I'm only giving you to the count of five.

1024
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:22,795
One, two, three, four...

1025
01:29:22,838 --> 01:29:25,673
Okay, all right! I promise I'll do it!

1026
01:29:27,551 --> 01:29:29,677
Good girl. Now, Scott,

1027
01:29:30,262 --> 01:29:32,889
we have even less time,
so I'm giving you the count of three.

1028
01:29:32,973 --> 01:29:35,350
- One...
- No, you don't believe in suicide.

1029
01:29:35,392 --> 01:29:39,437
It's not suicide, if you're already dead. Two.

1030
01:29:39,855 --> 01:29:42,232
Okay! Okay.

1031
01:29:43,192 --> 01:29:46,694
I'll kill you when you change.
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

1032
01:29:46,779 --> 01:29:47,779
Thank you, Son.

1033
01:29:48,197 --> 01:29:52,575
Okay, vampire killers,
let's kill some fucking vampires.

1034
01:30:13,389 --> 01:30:17,100
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

1035
01:30:17,184 --> 01:30:19,894
In the darkness have seen the light.

1036
01:30:21,563 --> 01:30:23,940
In the darkness, the light.

1037
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:46,212
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

1038
01:30:48,966 --> 01:30:50,508
Kill 'em all!

1039
01:32:17,638 --> 01:32:19,514
Come on! Come on!

1040
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,800
Dad?

1041
01:34:30,687 --> 01:34:32,396
Dad! No, Dad!

1042
01:34:32,606 --> 01:34:34,148
Dad! Dad!

1043
01:34:47,162 --> 01:34:49,372
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's name.

1044
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:52,667
Oh, my God!

1045
01:34:54,169 --> 01:34:55,711
Fight now, cry later!

1046
01:35:00,968 --> 01:35:05,304
Get the fuck off! Get off! Get off! Get 'em off!

1047
01:35:19,611 --> 01:35:20,861
Kill me, Kate.

1048
01:35:23,407 --> 01:35:25,032
Just kill me, Kate.

1049
01:35:26,868 --> 01:35:28,035
I can't.

1050
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,558
- How many bullets you have?
- I don't know. Not many.

1051
01:35:51,184 --> 01:35:53,894
When you run out, start cold-cocking 'em.
Make 'em sing for their supper.

1052
01:36:05,157 --> 01:36:08,326
Seth, should I save the last bullets for us?

1053
01:36:08,952 --> 01:36:11,662
No. Use it on the next fuck
that tries to bite you.

1054
01:36:22,007 --> 01:36:24,300
Shoot more holes. Shoot more holes!

1055
01:36:31,183 --> 01:36:33,100
- Perfect.
- They can't go into the light.

1056
01:36:33,477 --> 01:36:36,687
Perfect. All right, go.

1057
01:36:36,772 --> 01:36:38,606
Hey, Seth, don't leave me.

1058
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:43,778
Come here. Come here. Come on!

1059
01:36:45,447 --> 01:36:46,447
Come on, you!

1060
01:36:49,618 --> 01:36:50,785
Come here, you fucks!

1061
01:36:52,788 --> 01:36:55,456
Hello?
I'm looking for my friend Seth.

1062
01:36:55,957 --> 01:36:58,793
Carlos! Kick in the door!

1063
01:37:09,262 --> 01:37:10,304
Go!

1064
01:37:11,264 --> 01:37:12,682
Son of a bitch.

1065
01:37:43,255 --> 01:37:45,005
What the fuck was goin' on in there?

1066
01:37:50,637 --> 01:37:52,263
What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?

1067
01:37:52,347 --> 01:37:57,685
Why, out of all the godforsaken shit holes
in Mexico do we have to meet here?

1068
01:37:59,354 --> 01:38:01,355
One place is just as good as another.

1069
01:38:03,525 --> 01:38:04,734
You ever been here before?

1070
01:38:06,737 --> 01:38:09,822
No. I drove by it a couple times.

1071
01:38:10,198 --> 01:38:12,450
It's a rowdy place.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

1072
01:38:12,534 --> 01:38:14,827
There'll be no cops.
And it's open from dusk till dawn.

1073
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:17,204
Didn't you say you wanted to
meet in the morning? Here we are.

1074
01:38:17,247 --> 01:38:20,750
Well, since you just picked this
place out of a hat, my brother is dead,

1075
01:38:20,834 --> 01:38:24,211
that girl's entire fucking family is dead!

1076
01:38:27,758 --> 01:38:28,883
What were they? Psychos?

1077
01:38:29,718 --> 01:38:31,635
They look like psychos?
Is that what they looked like?

1078
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,720
They were vampires.

1079
01:38:32,804 --> 01:38:36,056
Psychos do not explode
when sunlight hits them.

1080
01:38:36,099 --> 01:38:37,892
I don't give a fuck how crazy they are!

1081
01:38:40,437 --> 01:38:43,230
Seth, how can I make it up to you?

1082
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:46,776
You can't make it up to me, Carlos.
You can't do it.

1083
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:48,736
Can't make it up!

1084
01:38:52,699 --> 01:38:57,244
15% instead of 30% for my stay
in El Rey, that's a good start.

1085
01:38:59,915 --> 01:39:00,956
Twenty-eight.

1086
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:03,501
My brother's gone.
You understand that?

1087
01:39:03,585 --> 01:39:06,587
He's gone and he's not coming back
and that is your fault.

1088
01:39:10,217 --> 01:39:11,342
Twenty.

1089
01:39:14,346 --> 01:39:15,513
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five.

1090
01:39:17,891 --> 01:39:20,351
Kate. Go to the RV, get the suitcase.

1091
01:39:26,316 --> 01:39:27,608
You look like hell.

1092
01:39:29,444 --> 01:39:31,779
You want a cold beer?
I got some in the car.

1093
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:35,783
Come on, they're cold. Huh?

1094
01:39:36,409 --> 01:39:37,952
I got Mexican and domestic.

1095
01:39:55,971 --> 01:39:58,180
So, how do you like the car?
It's all right.

1096
01:40:00,016 --> 01:40:02,768
I said "like new." This is a '90.

1097
01:40:03,103 --> 01:40:07,064
Hey, it is new, cabrn.
Belonged to a drug dealer friend of mine.

1098
01:40:07,232 --> 01:40:09,650
Hey, he only drove it,
like, 14 times in five years.

1099
01:40:09,693 --> 01:40:11,026
It's like new, I swear to God.

1100
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:17,783
- So, what do I do, follow you?
- Yeah, follow me.

1101
01:40:17,826 --> 01:40:18,868
All right, let's do it.

1102
01:40:28,003 --> 01:40:29,003
I'm sorry.

1103
01:40:41,808 --> 01:40:43,309
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

1104
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,403
- I'll see ya.
- Seth?

1105
01:40:57,866 --> 01:40:59,450
You need some company?

1106
01:41:03,288 --> 01:41:05,748
Kate, do you know where I'm going?
Do you know what El Rey is?

1107
01:41:08,418 --> 01:41:10,336
- No.
Hey, Seth.

1108
01:41:12,297 --> 01:41:13,714
It's time to go.

1109
01:41:16,259 --> 01:41:17,551
Go home, Kate.

1110
01:41:21,389 --> 01:41:23,849
I may be a bastard,
but I'm not a fucking bastard.

1111
01:41:58,718 --> 01:42:01,470
Hot air hangs like a dead man

1112
01:42:02,806 --> 01:42:04,890
From a white oak tree

1113
01:42:06,643 --> 01:42:09,561
People sittin' on porches

1114
01:42:09,938 --> 01:42:12,189
Thinking how things used to be

1115
01:42:12,732 --> 01:42:14,191
Dark night

1116
01:42:15,944 --> 01:42:18,070
It's a dark night

1117
01:42:19,864 --> 01:42:21,615
Dark night

1118
01:42:23,243 --> 01:42:25,119
It's a dark night

1119
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:05,701
Everything about her was natural

1120
01:43:06,494 --> 01:43:08,996
Everything about her was cool

1121
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:13,709
But I'm a little partial for beautiful giris

1122
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:18,213
Even if their bloods run blue

1123
01:43:20,508 --> 01:43:22,134
I think I see her

1124
01:43:24,179 --> 01:43:26,346
I think I want her

1125
01:43:28,141 --> 01:43:29,892
I think I love her

1126
01:43:29,976 --> 01:43:32,394
She's just killing me

1127
01:43:33,438 --> 01:43:36,023
I think she's killing me

1128
01:43:45,366 --> 01:43:48,243
Her castanets are enormous

1129
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:51,705
Her bongo beat absolute

1130
01:43:52,874 --> 01:43:56,251
And when she doin' midnight performances

1131
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,421
She's got a secret something to boot

1132
01:44:03,051 --> 01:44:04,718
I think I see her

1133
01:44:07,013 --> 01:44:08,430
I think I want her

1134
01:44:10,475 --> 01:44:12,226
Oh, I think I love her

1135
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:16,063
But she's just killing me, killing me

1136
01:44:16,147 --> 01:44:18,148
I think she's killing me

1137
01:45:21,004 --> 01:45:22,713
Oooh

1138
01:45:33,308 --> 01:45:36,935
Miss Santanico Pandemonium

1139
01:45:37,812 --> 01:45:40,480
Don't get any lower or slower

1140
01:45:41,274 --> 01:45:44,818
What you see is what you get conmigo

1141
01:45:45,153 --> 01:45:48,071
And the bonus of an albino boa

1142
01:45:51,868 --> 01:45:53,410
I think I see her

1143
01:45:55,288 --> 01:45:57,206
I think I want her

1144
01:45:58,917 --> 01:46:00,876
Yes, I think I love her

1145
01:46:01,252 --> 01:46:05,005
She's just killing me, killing me

1146
01:46:05,048 --> 01:46:08,300
She's just killing me
That's some time I had

1147
01:46:10,178 --> 01:46:12,804
Oh, I think I see her

1148
01:46:14,891 --> 01:46:16,767
I know I love her

1149
01:46:18,311 --> 01:46:20,479
Yes, I might love her

1150
01:46:20,521 --> 01:46:24,066
She's just killing me

1151
01:46:24,150 --> 01:46:26,526
She wanna be killing me

1152
01:46:26,569 --> 01:46:28,028
Suck my blood

1153
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,104
